                        <h1>The Tracks</h1>
                        <p class="freestyle">Ever since
        I was small
                I would always
Shut my eyes
        when the train
                approached,
As if it bore
        some kind of
                curse
That my gaze
        would unseal
                instantly,
Like a
        wrapped Christmas gift
                or a letter from a friend.
Well, it seems
        I was right
                all along.
Now bright yellow
        bile greets me
                on the platform,
The endless
        juice of my
                nightmares,
Of my fear
        coming
                true.
I will never go
        anywhere by train
                again
Only to see
        his last
                faltering steps
Replaying like a
        record
                in my head
Eternally.
        I wish I could
                forget.
I wish my brain would
        do me that favour,
                but my body
Is now numb,
        completely frozen,
                my voice disappears
As the air leaves my lungs
        in an instant
                and I am crushed,
Vacuum-sealed,
        similarly to his ribcage
                which exhales
For the last time
        under the
                wheels,
Split
        by a metal
                axis.
Had there been
        screams of pain
                they were drowned
By the squeal
        of the brakes
                and my head
Is now
        pounding,
                pounding…
Had anyone
        asked me for help
                I would have done
Nothing
        but stand there
                paralyzed.
Had the man spoken
        to me directly
                I would have probably
Shied away, afraid
        to get my stuff stolen
                or be late to work.
Anyhow, the result
        would have been
                the same
                in the end.
There was nothing
        to do;
                I know that.
But ghosts
        don’t care about
                this sort of thing.

The train leaves,
        blood-stained
                and indifferent.</p>
